Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Hong Kong with a passion for Robotics, advised by Professor Yi Ma. I graduated from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. My research goal is to build a universal robot to solve productivity challenges. I have conducted research at Tsinghua University, and I was a visiting student collaborating with robotics researchers at MIT, gaining valuable insights and aiming to make a significant impact in the field.
