Hi there! I am an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, with a passion for Robotics. My research goal is to build a universal robot to solve productivity challenges. I have conducted research at Tsinghua University, and I was a visiting student collaborating with robotics researchers at MIT, gaining valuable insights and aiming to make a significant impact in the field.

[Contact] If you are interested in chatting about robots, AI, research, cooking, Riot Games, the reason for why we are here, or anything else that wants to make a conversatio, feel free to shoot me an email at chenf20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn / winniechen315@qq.com.

Love yourselves guys, the future is ours.
