I am an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, with a passion for
Robotics. My research goal is to build a universal robot to solve productivity challenges. I
have conducted research at Tsinghua University, and I was a visiting student collaborating
with robotics researchers at MIT, gaining valuable insights and aiming to make a significant
impact in the field.
